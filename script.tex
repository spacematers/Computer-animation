\section{Tobi's adventure}

Introduction\\\\
Forest Sunday - A very fun day\\
A stick is thrown, and Tobi is going to go to find it. He starts to
run and he can see the nature, other animals, plants, the air on his face and
flowers. he trips whit a rock, but stand up quickly, the he find a very beautiful rain, filled by fishes, then he look around and see the stick
floating in the river.\\\\

Tobi (Intriguing and excited)\\
How can I get it? But I must to think fast because the river drags my stick. Right, I can see a trunk crossed, I can go on it and catch the stick.\\\\

Tobi starts to run to the trunk, wait and catch the stick, but at the same time
he slip and is going to fall into the river.\\\\

Aldo\\
Don't worry, I catch you, almost you get wet!\\\\

Tobi (Bit scared, but relieved)\\
Oh yeah! It was so close, damm it!\\\\

Then both of them go to another place away to keep playing.
